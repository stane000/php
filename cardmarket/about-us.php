			<p>Today, the development of the Internet has given rise to various online communities, through which members can trade collectible cards with each other. Cards are often bought and sold via eBay and other online retail sources. Many websites solicit their own "sell to us" page in hopes to draw in more purchase opportunities.</p>
			<p>The value of a trading card depends on a combination of the cards condition, the subjects popularity and the scarcity of the card. In some cases, especially with older cards that preceded the advent of card collecting as a widespread hobby, they have become collectors items of considerable value. In recent years, many sports cards have not necessarily appreciated as much in value due to overproduction.</p>
			<p>Trading cards, however, do not have an absolute monetary value. Cards are only worth as much as a collector is willing to pay.</p>
			<p>Card condition is one aspect of trading cards that determine the value of a card. There are four areas of interest in determining a cards condition. Centering, corners, edges and surface are taken into consideration, for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches and tears, when determining a trading cards value. Cards are considered poor to pristine based on their condition, or in some cases rated 1 through 10. A card in pristine condition, for example, will generally be valued higher than a card in poor condition.</p>
